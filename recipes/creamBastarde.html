    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Two cups of cow's milk, any kind</li>
            <li>Eight egg whites, gently beaten</li>
            <li>Three tablespoons of honey</li>
            <li>Salt to your liking</li>
            <li>One teaspoon of cane sugar</li>

        </ul>
    
    <br>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set aside a quarter cup of milk. Add the remaining milk and egg whites to a saucepan. Over low heat, bring the mixture to a boil, whisking continuously.</li>
            <li>Once your liquid reaches a rolling boil, remove it from heat, taking care to continue whisking fervishly. Add your salt and honey. Return the saucepan to low heat and continue stirring. In five to ten minutes your concoction will reach ultimate thickness.</li>
            <li>Let the thick bastard cream cool to room temperature. Pour cooled goo through a sieve (a fine-meshed colander.) Discard the liquid runoff. Take a spoon to break up your clumpy lumps.</li>
            <li>Transfer the thickness into your favorite bowl, add the reserved milk from step one.</li>
            <li>It's recommended that you garnish your creme bastarde with nutmeg, cane sugar, and your favorite fruits. But it's your dessert, do whatever makes your tastesbuds tingle.</li>
