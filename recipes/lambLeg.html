    <h1>Legendary Leg of Lamb</h1>

<h5>Description</h5>
    <p>It's now 2022, so one may ask themsleves, "Why do I have to cook this Lamb in a hole in the ground?"
       My friends, that's a fair question that will get a fairly convoluted answer.
      "Authenticity is key and your backyard grill sucks."
      This lamb is so divine, one may become a demigod after you've prepared it. 
      Earthy undertones, a mellow sweetness, and fresh herbs will ravage your senses. It's ravaging.
      *** Each time one makes this, it's mandatory the recipe is doubled. Pay respects to Chef Odin with a bountiful sacrifice.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One leg of lamb</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of honey</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of stone ground mustard</li>
        <li>Six to Eight cloves of Garlic (more if you'd like)</li>
    </ul>

<br>

<h3>The Pit</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Gather some friends and dig a pit, just shallow of two feet. It should have a diameter of at least eighteen inches</li>
      <li>Fill the bottom ten inches of the pit with firewood. Fill the rest of the pit with stones </li>
      <li>Light your kindling. The fire will be smoldering a little bit when the rocks are red hot  </li>
      <li>While the stones heat up, prepare the lamb</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make several slits in your cut of meat, equally stuffing each of them with garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Rub salt and pepper onto all sides of the meat.</li>
        <li>Cover the leg of Lamb with mustard and honey.</li>
        <li>Scatter fresh rosemary on the side facing up.</li>
        <li>Wrap the lamb in foil (centuries ago this would've been done with leaves.)</li>
        <li>Push the hot stones to the outskirts of the pit, making space for the foil wrapped lamb.</li>
        <li>Make sure there are no hot stones underneath or atop the lamb, they should be placed around the perimeter.</li>
        <li>Let the lamb sit for seventy-five minutes or so, without making any adjustments. Your meal should be ready when time is up!</li>
        <li>Fill your hole back up once you're done or make it a permanent barbecue pit!</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Optional</h5>
    <p>For any vegetarians one may be dining with, this recipe can be applied to most any vegetable. For anyone that likes a little green on their plate, one can wrap a vegetable coated in salt, pepper, garlic, and olive oil!</p>
