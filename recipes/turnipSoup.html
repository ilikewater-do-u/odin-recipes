    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the onion, without crying.</li>
            <li>Finely dice mushrooms and the peeled onion, keeping them separate.</li>
            <li>Slice turnip into pieces, so that each one is roughly half of an inch in size.</li>
            <li>Heat the seven tablespoons of butter, and olive oil in a heavy dutch oven, over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Sautee the onions for two minutes, then add the turnips, salt, and bay leaf stirring until very fragrant.</li>
            <li>If the pan has dried out; add a bit more olive oil followed by the bouillan and honey, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>When the bouillan, honey, and oil have turned into a homogenous liquid; add the milk and broth.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the soup simmer until turnips are soft. Do not stir while waiting.</li>
            <li>The milk will have coagulated after simmering for roughly twenty minutes. Pay it no mind.</li>
            <li>In a separate saucepan heat the tablespoon of butter, and suatee mushrooms over medium heat for three minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaf from the soup, and add the mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Puree the soup in a food processor or blender. Add more broth if the result is too thick!</li>
            <li>Serve the spectacular soup while it's hot! Either as an appetizer, or an enire meal.</li>
          </ol>
