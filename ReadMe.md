[Odin Recipes]

[The Odin Project] is an open source web-development course, empowering people to learn new skills at no cost. This website is intended for one's personal portfolio.

Mission Statement: Form an aggregate of tasty recipes, that almost any person could replicate. As long as the faux-chef pays attention.

This project is meant to sharpen one's skills by building bare boned websites with HTML.
